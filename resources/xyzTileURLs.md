# XYZ Tile Connections for QGIS

### Last updated: 01/5/2021


The following connections have been tested with QGIS version 3.10 and do not require a plugin to add to a QGIS Project.

Tom - Start each item with 1. and it will auto number for us later. The title will appear between [ ] brackets.  Then the URL is placed inside ( )
Try and sort the items alphabetically

1. [Esri World Gray Canvas] (https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Canvas/World_Light_Gray_Base/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x})
1. [Esri WorldTopoMap] (https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Topo_Map/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x})
1. Add the remainng ESRI items alphabetically after testing to make sure each works.
1. [MTB Map] (http://tile.mtbmap.cz/mtbmap_tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png) Covers Western Europe.
1. Third item

1. Add other OSM maps
